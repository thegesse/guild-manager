## about
### A coding project for the js module, were I had to make a manager interface and be able to make them fight, see and add quests/adventurers, and manage their inventories.
### Some values are missing or arent pre set like the inventory.
### The html and css is made with ai, I do apologize in advance for that, a few attempts of animations with ai were made but I gave up
